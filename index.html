          <h3>My name is Kenny.</h3> 
        
        <p>
          I am a student for Thinkful's Flex Bootcamp. I currently live at
          Manhattan, NYC.
        </p>
        
        <p>As a college student, I am interested in photography, computer graphics and fitness.</p>

        <h2>About Kenny</h2>
        
        <p>
          I am currently a student at Berkeley College. As a kid, I was always
          interested in how to create a website. In high school, there were only
          a few classes that would excite me. One of them being computer
          programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, what brought me into web development are the people
          who are interested in it as well. During my first year of college, I
          signed up for a coding club. Although, there weren't many students in
          the club. We were all there as a team to help each other learn
          together. Solving problems and developing websites bring a the
          satisfaction that I am where I am supposed to be.
